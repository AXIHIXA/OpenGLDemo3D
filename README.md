# OpenGLDemo3D

## Overview

Implemented a sample program to display flat-shaded triangle, tetrahedron and sphere (with tessellation shaders). 
Also implemented a FPS-style camera and local illumination with the Phong shading model. 

Note: Directory `./var/` contains vertices for the required polyhedral objects. 
Each line denotes a 3D point (x, y, and z coordinates), and each 3 lines denote a triangular facet. 
Note that many points are duplicated as they appear in multiple facets!

## Dependencies

- OpenGL (Required for Both Versions):
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kisak/kisak-mesa
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo reboot
```
- Further Needed for the C/C++ Version: 
  - [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
    - Configuration w.r.t. results of `sudo glxinfo | grep "OpenGL`
    - Command `glxinfo` needs `mesa-utils`
  - Remaining dependencies could be installed via apt:
  ```bash
  apt install libopencv-dev libglm-dev libglew-dev libglfw3-dev mesa-utils libx11-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev
  ```
- Further Needed for the Python Version (from PyPI):
```bash
pip install PyOpenGL PyGLM glfw
```

## Compile & Run

- C/C++ Version (Run inside `cpp/`): 
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make 
cd ..
./build/OpenGLDemo3D
```
- Python Version. Run inside `py/`, and replace "py3" with your own conda env name:
```bash
conda activate py3
python main.py
```

## Usage

- Press `W`/`S`/`A`/`D`/`UP`/`DOWN`, or drag/scroll the mouse to adjust the camera. 

## Notes

- In this program, the sphere parameters passed into tessellation shaders via shader uniforms. 
  Note how this differs from the "pass-by-vertex-attribute-array" method for the circle example; 
- If this program does not work on your VMWare virtual environment, 
  please try to [disable the 3D acceleration feature](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/59146).
